### Adding a new language
- Clone the repo
- Create a new file `[YOUR_LANGUAGE].js` in the `locales` folder.
- In it, copy and paste the contents of the file the language from which you want to translate, for example `en.js`.
- Translate it 😄🙏
- Add your language key in `locales/index.js`. It must be the exact same key you used to name your file `[YOUR_LANGUAGE].js`
